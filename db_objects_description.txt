When you install the postgres_air, you will have all the tables with data 
and integrity constraints, but no indexes except for the PK/UQ and no large objects

The indexes_up.sql file contains all indexes which are used in the PostgreSQL Optimization
book, you may choose which one you need or create your own.

The tables directory contains the code to build large tables, which we used to demonstrate 
some optimization techniques. You can use this code or come up with your own.

The types and functions directories contain the code for the functions which were created 
for the PostgreSQL Optimization book, including the ones which utilize NORM methodology.

See  https://github.com/hettie-d/NORM  for details.
